## Planning

### Ideas
- Facial Recognition
- Detect danger
    - Checks for dangerous items/hazards
    - Rates the scene on a scale of 0 - 1
- Recognise songs from an artist(s)

### Final Choice

### The problem
We need to create a novel and enjoyable music recognition system to detect and classify songs from users favourite artits. 

Primarily designed for spontaneous use to help the user identify a song they can't quite remember the name of.

### Stakeholders
Our application would be primarily for avid music listeners who are particularly interested in updating and adding to playlists.

In terms of age range and demographic, our target audience would stretch to everyone who listens to music or for anyone capable of listening to music.

### Research
Simmilar solutions to this problem include
- [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/)
- [AHA Music Recognition](https://www.aha-music.com/identify-songs-music-recognition-online)
- [Google "hum to search"](https://blog.google/products/search/hum-to-search/)

Shazam - owned by Apple - is the most popular solution to music recognition with one of the largest databases for music recognition. They have integration with apple music and are embedded into many iPhones out-of-the-box

### Features
- Primary Features
    - Must be able to distinguish, with a high enough accuracy, the correct song
    - Must have at least 25 songs 
    - Should run locally
- Extension Features
    - Can recognise patterns between songs to recommend new ones
    - Can extend its database by scraping youtube (will need to check tos and permission)
    - Could keep track of the amount of people who looked up the song
