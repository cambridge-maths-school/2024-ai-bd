### The problem
We need to create a novel and enjoyable music recognition system to detect and classify songs from users favourite artits. 

Primarily designed for spontaneous use to help the user identify a song they can't quite remember the name of.

### Stakeholders
Our application would be primarily for avid music listeners who are particularly interested in updating and adding to playlists.

### Research

### Features
- Primary Features
    - Must be able to distinguish with a high enough accuracy the correct song
- Extension Features
    - Can recognise patterns between songs to recommend new ones
